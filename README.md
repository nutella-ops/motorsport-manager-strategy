# Motorsport Manager Strategy

**Short Story:**
	A data organizer to keep track of game data for ease of strategy management.

**Long Story:**
	I am not great at long term, dynamic planning and management which makes up a central element of the game. I saw an opportunity to put the track attributes (i.e. low-speed corner, high-speed corner, tire wear, ...) into data structures so I could search the data quickly and easily, as keeping it all in my head was time consuming, ineffective and made the game a chore. This was made long before my programming abilities were up to the tasks I wished to pursue. This is a project in the same category as the War Thunder Data Visualizer, in that it is a quick project to explore new topics, experiences and use my skills beneficially.
